# Code of Conduct 

## Pledge 
- We desire a productive, cheerful, and adaptable community that can accept new ideas in a complicated subject, enhance every process frequently and stimulate collaboration among groups with a wide range of requirements, interests, and abilities. We get strength from variety and actively seek out those who contribute to it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that people from different backgrounds work together for mutual benefit and enjoyment. We will confront prejudices that may jeopardize anyone's participation in the project.

## Our Community 
Members of this group are friendly, considerate, and respectful of one another. Positive behaviors that reinforce these ideals include:

- Be considerate
- Be respectful
- Take responsibility for our words and our actions
- Be collaborative
- Be generous
- Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus
- Ask for help when unsure
- Step down considerately
- Acknowledging time and effort

## Our Standards
Every person of our community has the right to be appreciated for who they are. Regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, handicap, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status, this community is dedicated to providing a pleasant experience for everyone.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilites 
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the acceptable behavior standards and are expected to respond to any instances of unacceptable behavior with appropriate and equitable corrective action. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct, as well as to ban contributors temporarily or permanently for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope 
When an individual is representing the project or its community, this Code of Conduct applies both within project areas and in public spaces. Using an official project e-mail address, publishing via an official social media account, or serving as an appointed representative at an online or offline event are all examples of representing a project or community. Project maintainers can further define and clarify a project's representation.

## Consequences
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
